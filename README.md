 I worked on a Music Playlist App that demonstrates the power of Lists and Keys in React.js.

🔍 Key Features:

Dynamic display of track items with the ability to search and filter tracks.

Delete functionality that instantly removes tracks from the list.

A user-friendly "No Songs Found" view when no matching tracks are found or when all tracks are deleted.

🎨 Tech Stack:
React.js for component-based architecture
Styled-components for design
Robust state management to handle track filtering and deletion

Challenges: Ensuring that the app handles empty search results gracefully and testing the app to meet all specified requirements.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of Lists and Keys in React, making it easier to manage and render complex data structures in a seamless way.
